# About Me:

Hello there! I'm Shiva Sajay, a budding developer from Kochi with a passion for AI and web development. Currently pursuing my bachelor's degree in Information Technology, I'm focused on building practical projects that solve real-world problems. I love exploring new technologies and am particularly excited about the possibilities of AI and web development. When I'm not coding, you'll find me working on side projects or learning new tech skills.

All of my projects are available on my portfolio website: [your-website-here]
